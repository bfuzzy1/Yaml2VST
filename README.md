Yaml2VST is a tool for converting YAML configurations into Verified Security Tests (VST) code. It simplifies the process of generating security tests based on YAML-defined configurations, making it easy to automate and verify security-related tasks.

## Usage

Yaml2VST is straightforward to use. You provide a YAML configuration file, and it generates VST code based on the hardcoded template provided in the source code. Here's an example of how to use it:

```shell
./yaml2vst -yaml config.yaml
```

- `-yaml`: Specify the path to your YAML configuration file.

## Examples

To help you get started quickly, here's an example YAML configuration:

LINK TO EXAMPLE YAML CONFIGURATION HERE!!!!!!

```yaml
# Example YAML Configuration
id: example-test
name: Example Security Test
unit: security
created: 2023-11-30 10:00:00
```

This YAML configuration, when processed by Yaml2VST, will generate VST code based on the hardcoded template defined in the source code.
